# NavObjectVersion
This tiny application will assist all NAV Developers to easily export their project's object list from NAV Object Designer and format it in a customer facing presentable way.

No more replacing Type 1 to Table!

Using MS Word and MS Excel interop, you can simply select your objects in NAV, copy them (Ctrl+C) and paste them in this app.
The app will use the template Word file provided and will output a formatted Word Table with your object list.

You have the option to either open the created Word document to edit it or to copy the formatted result to Windows Clipboard so you can go to any application (such as Word, Outlook, etc.) and paste it (Ctrl+V).

Hopefully this will save everyone a lot of time.

Thanks,
