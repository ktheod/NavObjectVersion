# NavObjectVersion
This tiny application will assist all NAV Developers to easily export their project's object list from NAV Object Designer and format it in a customer facing presentable way.

No more replacing Type 1 to Table!

You can simply select your objects in NAV, copy them (Ctrl+C) and paste them in the app.
The app will use the template Word file provided and will output a formatted object list ready to use in your release note or email.

You have the option to either open the created Word document to edit it or to copy the formatted result directly to Windows Clipboard so you can go to any application (such as Word, Outlook, etc.) and paste it (Ctrl+V).


To Install, simply download the release ZIP file, unzip it, run setup.exe and then copy file NAVObjectVersion_Template.docx to whatever folder you want to save it.

To Run it, locate the app in your Windows Start Menu.

To select your template Word Document, double click on the textbox next to "Template Used"
